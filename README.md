# Triangle Checker

## Description
**Triangle Checker** is a simple web-based application that allows users to plot points on a coordinate plane, generate all possible triangles from those points, and determine which of the triangles are acute. This project is designed to help users visualize and understand the properties of triangles in a fun and interactive way.

## Features
- **Point Plotting:** Users can click on a canvas to plot points, which will be used to form triangles.
- **Triangle Generation:** The application calculates all possible triangles that can be formed from the plotted points.
- **Acute Triangle Detection:** The app identifies and highlights triangles where all three angles are acute.
- **Interactive Menu:** A user-friendly interface lets users toggle between viewing all triangles and only acute triangles.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling the canvas and interface.
- **JavaScript**: For handling logic, including point plotting, triangle calculations, and acute triangle detection.

## How to Use
1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. Click on the canvas to plot points.
3. Use the provided buttons to display all possible triangles or only acute triangles.
4. Observe the results directly on the canvas.

## Future Enhancements
- Add functionality to clear points and reset the canvas.
- Implement more advanced triangle classifications (e.g., right, obtuse).
- Allow users to input points manually via coordinates.
