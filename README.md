# Triangle-Checker
Triangle Checker is a simple web-based application that allows users to plot points on a coordinate plane, generate all possible triangles from those points, and determine which of the triangles are acute. This project is designed to help users visualize and understand the properties of triangles in a fun and interactive way.
